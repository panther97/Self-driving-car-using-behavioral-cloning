# Self-driving-car-using-behavioral-cloning
  The goal of this project is to train a convolutional neural
  networks based behavioral cloning model to drive a car autonomously.
  This will be done in a simulator provided by Udacity. Various computer
  vision principles were used in the
  development. The simulator is used for both training and testing. To
  collect the data, the car was run on a virtual track in training mode.
  This data was fed for training to our model. The network picks up on
  our driving decisions corresponding to the state of the road, such as when
  to turn. The model is then saved and is run in the autonomous/ testing
  mode of the simulator in order to test its performance (on a track that
  it has never seen before).

Following is the video of car running on a track autonomously.

<b>How to run<b>
1. Run requirements.txt
2. Run Drive.py
3. Open the simulator
4. Click on "Autonomous Mode" in the simulator
5. Watch the car self-drive :)
